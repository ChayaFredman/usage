Hi.

1. I didn't understand why you need the TxGroupDate model.
2. Please keep the code order and proper indentation, if you want other people to read your code without a mess.
3. Remove any method you don't need in the controllers, or files you don't use as helpers etc. Keep the code thin.
4. 'Trygruff' shouldn't need to be an ActiveRecord model, Am I right?
5. If you have a full DB then I will be able to play with the views and check the JS code. Thanks.
6. 'date1' is a strange name for column, sorry.

This all for now.
Good Luck!!!
